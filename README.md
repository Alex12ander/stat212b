Topics Course on Deep Learning for Spring 2016

##Syllabus

### 1st part: Convolutional Neural Networks
  - Invariance, stability.
  - Variability models (deformation model, stochastic model). 
  - Scattering
  - Extensions ( recent arvix paper ) 
  - Group Formalism 
  - Supervised Learning: classification. 
  - Properties of CNN representations: invertibility? stability? invariance. 
  - covariance/invariance: capsules and related models
  - Connections with other models: dictionary learning, LISTA, Random Forests
  - Other tasks: localization, regression. Embeddings (DrLim), inverse problems 
  - Extensions to non-euclidean domains?
  - Dynamical systems: RNNs and optimal control. 
  - Guest Lecture??
